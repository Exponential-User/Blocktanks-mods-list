### This is where I keep my Blocktanks mods in

Each folder will have a video and/or instructions.txt for installation

If you have an issue with one of these mods
Please open a new issue in the Issues tab, With errors/warns and mod name provided for easier debugging

> The ModLoader is WIP and will not work yet, When the loader is released then the mods listed here will reqiure it

## lightMode-UBTM
The UBTM mod does not require anything, This goes for visuals, If you like the classic/cartoony style then don't use this.

UBTM gives you shadows, gradients, some animated buttons/weapons, and text decorations.

You can suggest something in the issues tab! :)

## Join-Alert
#### This script will not work after the player-match leak is fixed, Unless I find a way which I have and currently coding it.
This outputs to the chat ( e.g.: [USERNAME] has joined/Left ).

This does not support guests. (Soon)

The joining/leaving message only shows to you.

This has a respones time like around 3-5 seconds (Tested this in a minute, I don't know how accurate it is, Will change hopefully once updated).
If you want to change the delay that checks for new players, change this:
```js
const delay1 = 750; // At line 4
```
