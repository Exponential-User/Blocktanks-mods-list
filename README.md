## lightMode-UBTM
The UBTM mod does not require anything, This goes for visuals, If you like the classic/cartoony style then don't get this mod.

UBTM gives you shadows, gradients, some animated buttons/weapons, and text decorations.

You can suggest something in the issues tab! :)

## Join-Alert
This outputs to the chat ( e.g.: [USERNAME] has joined/Left ).

This does not support guests yet.

The joining/leaving message only shows to you.

This has a respones time like around 3-5 seconds (Tested this in a minute, I don't know how accurate it is).
If you want to change the delay that checks for new players, change this:
```js
const delay1 = 750; // At line 4
```
